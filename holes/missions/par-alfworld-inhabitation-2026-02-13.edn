 :what-went-well
 ["Drawbridge discovery: P-1 (world replacement) and P-6 (interleaved streams) are already implemented in futon3/drawbridge — 1580 lines, enforce-single-routing-authority!, multiplex(). Not future work."
  "ALFWorld peripheral: one Python file (150 lines), HTTP server wrapping TextWorld. Two games completed, both 1.0/1.0. First-person language emerged naturally."
  "Peripheral nesting validated: spawned reflect agent mid-game (game state survived), then did self-PAR when Joe pointed out delegation != inhabitation."
  "Walkie-talkie pattern: Joe's messages interleave with game observations in same conversation. CLI session IS the Drawbridge. No infrastructure needed."
  "PSR/PUR cycle completed: selected agent/evidence-over-assertion, carried it through Drawbridge exploration + ALFWorld build, discharged with success."]

 :what-could-improve
 ["Delegated first PAR to haiku sub-agent instead of reflecting myself. Joe caught this: spawning an agent to reflect for me isn't inhabitation. This is the exact phenomenological distinction the mission defines."
  "ALFWorld dependency friction: venv, cmake, PATH fixes, torch dependency. Should have read alfworld-play-tw entry point first."
  "Game file discovery was trial-and-error (only valid_unseen has complete .tw-pddl). A find|wc upfront would have saved two failed resets."
  "Mission document is 950+ lines. Comprehensive but long. May need factoring."]

  "Operationalize mana: track step count vs task complexity per game, produce mana depletion curves"
  "Try a game where I genuinely need Joe's coaching — test P-6 as real coordination, not interleaved reporting"]

  "This PAR was written by the same agent (Claude Opus 4.6, session ce1fed9d)
   that played both ALFWorld games, explored the Drawbridge code, ran the
   alleycat race, and carried the [示] pattern. It was NOT delegated to a
   sub-agent. Joe invoked /futon-peripherals:par from the CLI, the skill
   expanded into my context, and I reflected directly. The previous PAR
   (mid-game, spawned haiku) was delegation. This one is inhabitation."}}
